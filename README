This project is currently under construction, but all of the interactions between classes
should be operating properly. No numbers are balanced and the game doesn't run fully yet.
Must use the WAD file given. Project is reviewable.

Text RPG based on the popular FPS Doom. The Doom engine was open sourced
after its release, and was built to be very modular. The engine itself
can be modified and improved upon by modders, but its real strength lies
in the fact that (on Linux), you pass in a .wad or .iwad file to the 
engine executable. The Wad contains all map information, including enemies,
weapon drops, powerups, ammo, and map layout.

We plan to execute this project in much the same way - the code written
will take in a text file containing specifically formatted information
about a map, and run the game based on that information. In this way,
logic and gameplay are separated and anyone who doesn't know how to code
can still create their own maps.
