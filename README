Usage: compile with make and run "./texDoom x", where x is the name of the wad file.

For testing, or if you just want to mess around, make your name "iddqd". This will give you 10,000 health
and allow you to run your game without fear of dying.

Wad construction:
Anyone should be able to make their own wad for use with the engine. Each line in the
wad corresponds to a room in the game, and wads are setup in a specific way.
In the excel sheet above, each item in the game has a designation, e.g. the plasma rifle
designation is PLS. If you want to spawn a plasma rifle in the room, type "PLS1" 
on the line. If you want to spawn 3 lost souls in the same room, type "LOS3" on the same
line. Ammo drops have built in quantities listed on the sheet; for instance if you type
"AMC2", that corresponds to 2 plasma cell ammo drops of 100 cells each. 

This project is currently under construction, but it should be good to test.

Text RPG based on the popular FPS Doom. The Doom engine was open sourced
after its release, and was built to be very modular. The engine itself
can be modified and improved upon by modders, but its real strength lies
in the fact that (on Linux), you pass in a .wad or .iwad file to the 
engine executable. The Wad contains all map information, including enemies,
weapon drops, powerups, ammo, and map layout.

We plan to execute this project in much the same way - the code written
will take in a text file containing specifically formatted information
about a map, and run the game based on that information. In this way,
logic and gameplay are separated and anyone who doesn't know how to code
can still create their own maps.
